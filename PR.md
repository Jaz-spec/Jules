# Automated Accessibility Improvements

This PR contains accessibility improvements generated by the Gemini CLI based on guidelines in `access-info.md`.

## Changes Made
- **Corrected Form Input**: In `index.html`, removed a redundant `placeholder` from the "Last name" input field and added the `name` attribute for better form handling.
- **Code Cleanup**: Removed comments from `index.html` that incorrectly identified accessibility issues which were not present in the code.

## Files Modified
- `index.html`

## Further changes to make
- **Color Contrast**: The paragraph in `index.html` with the text "This text has poor color contrast" has a style of `color: #ADADAD` on a `#FFFFFF` background. This does not meet the WCAG AA standard of 4.5:1. The colors should be adjusted manually to provide sufficient contrast.
