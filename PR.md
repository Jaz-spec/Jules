*   **Image Alt Text**: The `alt` text for `<img src="https://via.placeholder.com/40">` was set to "Placeholder image". Please review if this is accurate or if a more descriptive text is needed.
*   **Link Accessible Name**: The link containing a "⚙️" icon was given an `aria-label="Settings"`. Please confirm this is the correct destination and label.
*   **Color Contrast**: The paragraph with low-contrast text (`#ADADAD` on `#FFFFFF`) was changed to `#333333` on `#FFFFFF` to meet the 4.5:1 ratio. Please review the new color to ensure it aligns with the design system.
*   **Marquee Replacement**: The `<marquee>` element was replaced with a static `<p>` tag. Please review this change as it alters the visual presentation.
