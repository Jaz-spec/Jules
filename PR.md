# Automated Accessibility Improvements

This PR contains accessibility improvements generated by the Gemini CLI based on guidelines in \`access-info.md\`.

## Changes Made
- **Associated Labels with Inputs**: Added the `for` attribute to labels in the form to explicitly link them to their corresponding inputs, improving screen reader accuracy.
- **Replaced Placeholder with Label**: Replaced a placeholder-only input with a proper `<label>` for "Last name" to ensure the field is clearly identified.
- **Added Alt Text to Image**: Provided descriptive `alt` text for an image to make its content accessible to users who cannot see it.
- **Used Semantic Button**: Replaced a `<div>` acting as a button with a semantic `<button>` element for better keyboard navigation and screen reader recognition.
- **Provided ARIA Label for Icon Link**: Added an `aria-label` to a link containing only an icon to give it an accessible name.
- **Corrected Table Structure**: Implemented `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, and `<th>` tags in the table to define a proper header and body, making the data easier to understand for assistive technologies.
- **Added Legend to Fieldset**: Included a `<legend>` in the `<fieldset>` to describe the grouping of form controls.
- **Resolved Duplicate IDs**: Ensured all `id` attributes are unique to prevent conflicts with assistive technologies and JavaScript.
- **Removed Marquee Element**: Replaced the deprecated and distracting `<marquee>` element with a static `<p>` tag.

## Files Modified
- `index.html`

## Further changes to make
- **Color Contrast**: The paragraph with the text "This text has poor color contrast" has a color contrast ratio of 1.77:1, which is below the recommended 4.5:1 ratio. This requires a manual update to the color values in the inline style to ensure readability for users with low vision.
