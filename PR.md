# Automated Accessibility Improvements

This PR contains accessibility improvements generated by the Gemini CLI based on guidelines in `access-info.md`.

## Changes Made
- Added `for` attribute to labels to associate them with form inputs.
- Added labels for inputs that were using placeholders as labels.
- Added `alt` text to images.
- Replaced `div` elements used as buttons with semantic `<button>` elements.
- Added `aria-label` to links that only contain icons.
- Used `<th>` for table headers for proper table structure.
- Added `<legend>` to fieldsets.
- Fixed duplicate IDs.
- Removed obsolete `<marquee>` element.
- Removed redundant `placeholder` from the "Last name" input and added a `name` attribute for better form handling.
- Cleaned up comments that incorrectly pointed out issues that were already resolved.

## Files Modified
- `index.html`

## Further changes to make
- The text with the hex code `#ADADAD` has insufficient color contrast against a white background. This needs to be addressed manually to ensure it aligns with the design.
