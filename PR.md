# AI-Generated Accessibility PR Notes

## PR Notes for index.html
*   **Color Contrast**: The text color in one paragraph was changed from `#ADADAD` to `#000000` to meet the minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio. Please verify that this new color aligns with the design system.
*   **Alternative Text**: An `alt` attribute of "Placeholder image icon" was added to an image. Please review if this description is accurate for the image's purpose.
*   **ARIA Label**: An `aria-label="Settings"` was added to a link containing only an icon to provide an accessible name. Please confirm this accurately describes the link's destination.
*   **Fieldset Legend**: A `<legend>` with the text "User Information" was added to a `<fieldset>`. Please review if this is an appropriate title for the form section.
*   **Marquee Removal**: The `<marquee>` element was replaced with a static `<p>` tag as the marquee element is obsolete and presents an accessibility issue. Please confirm this change is acceptable.
